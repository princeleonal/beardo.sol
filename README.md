# MyToken Smart Contract

This is a Solidity smart contract for a token called "BEARDO". The contract includes a mint function to create new tokens and a burn function to destroy existing tokens. The contract is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing users to adjust the token name, abbreviation, and total supply as needed.

## Getting Started

To use this smart contract, you'll need to have a Solidity development environment set up, such as Remix or Truffle. Once you have a development environment running, you can deploy the contract to a local testnet or to a public blockchain network.

## Usage

The MyToken contract includes the following functions:

### mint

```solidity
function mint(address _address, uint _value) public
```

The `mint` function creates new tokens and adds them to the specified address. The function takes two parameters:

- `_address`: the address to receive the new tokens
- `_value`: the amount of tokens to create

### burn

```solidity
function burn(address _address, uint _value) public
```

The `burn` function destroys existing tokens and subtracts them from the specified address. The function takes two parameters:

- `_address`: the address to subtract the tokens from
- `_value`: the amount of tokens to destroy

## Customization

The MyToken contract includes several public variables that can be customized to meet your needs:

- `tokenName`: the name of the token (default: "BEARDO")
- `tokenAbbrv`: the abbreviation of the token (default: "BRD")
- `totalSupply`: the total supply of the token (default: 0)

You can adjust these variables before deploying the contract to customize the token to your liking.
